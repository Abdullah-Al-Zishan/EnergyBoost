# EnergyBoost: Learning-based Control of Home Batteries

EnergyBoost employs accurate supervised learning models 
for predicting the next day available solar energy and household demand, and 
physical models that closely approximate the output of a solar inverter
and the state of charge (SoC) of a lithium-ion battery. 
It formulates the control of battery charge and discharge operations 
as an optimal control problem over a finite time horizon.
