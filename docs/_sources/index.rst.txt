Welcome to EnergyBoost's documentation!
=====================================================
EnergyBoost employs accurate supervised learning models for predicting the next day available solar energy and household demand, and physical models that closely approximate the output of a solar inverter and the state of charge (SoC) of a lithium-ion battery. It formulates the control of battery charge and discharge operations as an optimal control problem over a finite time horizon.
